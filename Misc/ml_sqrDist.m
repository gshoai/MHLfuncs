function SqrDist = ml_sqrDist(Data1, Data2)
% Compute square Euclidean distances.
% Usages:
% Inputs:
%   Data1: a d*n matrix representing a set of d-dim data points.
%   Data2: a d*m matrix representing a second set of d-dim data points.
% Outputs:
%   SqrDist: a n*m matrix, the entry in i_th row and j_th column represents
%       the square Euclidean distance between the i_th data point of Data1
%       and the j_th data point of Data2.
% See also: function pdist from Statistics ToolBox. 
% However, pdist is much slower than this function.
