This contains Matlab functions that support various tasks, including classification 
(e.g., SVM, ridge regression, kernel computation, kNN), evaluation (e.g., computing ROC and AP), 
optimization (e.g., Sgd, Asgd), parallelism (e.g., parallel k-means), utility functions 
(e.g., load and save in Matlab, create latex table), video handling (frame extraction, 
mp4 video clip creation, video shot detection, video thread creation). 
These functions are frequently used in my research. Some of them might be useful for other people.

This is version 4.0. Previous versions are MyGradFuncs.
This version is a clean-up version of MyGradFuncs with the removal of obsolete functions.
